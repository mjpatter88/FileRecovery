 performance, was 3.9, a 32% loss comparedto anSMTthat speculates. Our results for the other benchmarks show thesame phenomena, although the other workloads benefit less from speculation.In summary, not speculating wastes more resources than mispeculating.3.1.1 Fetch Policies. It is possible that more speculation-aware fetch policiesmight outperform SMT’s default fetch algorithm, ICOUNT, reducing thenumber of wrong-path instructions while increasing the number of correct-pathand nonspeculative instru
