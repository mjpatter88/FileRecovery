 branch predictors underSMT. They determine that both constructive and destructive interferenceaffect branch prediction accuracy on SMT, but they do not address the issue ofspeculation.Golla and Lin [1998] investigate a notion similar to fetch-to-fetch delay andits effect on speculation in the context of fine-grained-multithreading architectures.They find that as instruction queues became larger, the probability of aspeculative instruction being on the correct path decreases dramatically. Theysolve
