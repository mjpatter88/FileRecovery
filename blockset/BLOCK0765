The third uses branch confidence estimators tofavor threads with high-confidence branches. In all cases, ICOUNT breaksties.Our baseline experiments used the McFarling branch prediction algorithm[McFarling 1993] used on modern processors from Hewlett Packard; forsome studies we augmented this with confidence estimators. Our simulatorspeculates past
