o latency-hiding techniques, and to askwhether multithreaded processors should speculate differently than conventional superscalars.This paper evaluates the behavior of instruction speculation on SMT processors using both multiprogrammed(SPECINT and SPECFP) and multithreaded (the ApacheWeb server) workloads.Wemeasure and analyze the impact of speculation and demonstrate how speculation on an 8-contextSMTdiffers from superscalar speculation.We also examine the effect of speculation-aware fetch andbranc
