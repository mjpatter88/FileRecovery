ation, we followed all instructions through the executionpipeline. At each pipeline stage we measured the average number of each of thethree instruction types that leaves that stage each cycle. We call these valuesthe correct-path-speculative, wrong-path-speculative, and non-speculative perstageIPCs. The overall machine IPC is the sum of the correct-path-speculativeand non-speculative commit IPCs.Figures 1–4 depict these per-stage instruction categories for all four workloads.While bottom line IPC of
