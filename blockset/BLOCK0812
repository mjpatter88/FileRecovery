o right of fetch policies differs between workloads. For SPECINT95, no speculation performedworst; the soft confidence schemes were next, followed by the distance estimator (threshD3), thestrong count schemes, and favoring non-speculative contexts. The ordering for SPECINTCFP isthe same. For SPECFP95, soft confidence and favoring nonspeculative contexts performed worst,followed by no speculation and strong count, distance, and JRS hard confidence estimators. Finally,for Apache, soft confidence outperfo
