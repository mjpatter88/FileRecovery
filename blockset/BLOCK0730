he SimOS framework [Rosenblum et al. 1995; Redstoneet al. 2000; Compaq 1998]. It simulates the full pipeline and memory hierarchy,including bank conflicts and bus contention, for both the applications and theoperating system.The baseline configuration for our experiments is shown in Table I. For mostexperiments we used the ICOUNT fetch policy [Tullsen et al. 1996]. ICOUNTgives priority to threads with the fewest number of instructions in the preissuestages of the pipeline and fetches 8 instructions (
