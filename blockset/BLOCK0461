r work)or threads are not being fetched (ours). Klauser and Grunwald [1999] demonstratea similar technique, but they do not restrict the creation of speculativethreads to the highest confidence path. Instead, they use a confidence estimatorto determine when to create a new speculative thread. Because of this differencein their design, ICOUNT performs very poorly, while a confidence-basedpriority scheme performs much better.Seng et al. [2000] examine the effects of speculation on power consumptionin
