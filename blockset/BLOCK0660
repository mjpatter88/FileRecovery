acteristicsWe examine three modifications to the SMT hardware that affect how speculationbehaves: the number of hardware contexts, the number of functional units,and the size of the level-one caches. While some of these are aggressive, theyprovide insights into design options and trade-offs surrounding the SMT microarchitectureand illuminate the boundaries of speculation performance. Themore conservative configurations are representative of machines that alreadyexist, for example, Marr et al. [2002];
