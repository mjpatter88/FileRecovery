to their simple behavior and small size (there isno need to warm the L2 cache), were simulated for only 1 million cycles each.Other researchers have demonstrated that, for SPECINT95 and Apache, oursegments are well past the beginning of steady-state execution [Redstone et al.2000]. To ensure that the portions of execution for the other benchmarks arerepresentative, we performed some longer simulations and found they had nosignificant effect on our results. For machine configurations with more than 8c
