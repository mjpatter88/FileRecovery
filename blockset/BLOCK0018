creases. Consequently,more nonspeculative threads will be available to provide instructions, reducingthe value of speculation. As a result, branch prediction accuracy willhave to be higher for speculation to pay off for larger basic block sizes.(3) As ILP within a basic block increases, the number of unused resourcesdeclines, causing speculation to benefit performance less.Figure 6 illustrates the trade-offs in all three of these parameters. The horizontalaxis is the number of instructions between br
