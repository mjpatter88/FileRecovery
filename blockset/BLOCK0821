se two options. Then we discuss the impactof speculation-aware fetch policies and the use of branch prediction confidenceestimators on speculation performance.3.1 The Behavior of Speculative InstructionsAs a first task, we modified our SMT simulator to turn off speculation (i.e.,the processor never fetches past a branch until it has resolved it) and comparedthe throughput in instructions per cycle on our four workloads with aspeculative SMT CPU. The results of these measurements, seen in Table II,sh
