etweenbranches, 91% prediction accuracy), branch prediction accuracy wouldhave to be worse than 98%, 88% and 55%, respectively. SPECFP95 comes closeto hitting the crossover point; this is consistent with the relatively smallerperformance gain due to speculation for SPECFP95 that we saw in Section 3.5Compiler optimization was set to -O5 on Compaq’s F77 compiler, which unrolls loops below acertain size (100 cycles of estimated execution) by a factor of four or more. SPECFP benchmarkshave large basic bl
