perscalar), it speculates less aggressively past branches (past1.4 branches on average compared to 3.5 branches on a superscalar). Thiscauses the percentage of speculative instructions fetched to decline from 93%on a superscalar to 57% on SMT. More important, it also reduces the percentageof speculative instructions on the wrong path; because an SMT processormakes less progress down speculative paths, it avoids multiple levels of speculativebranches, which impose higher (compounded) misprediction rate
