In the previous section, we showed that speculation benefits SMT performancefor our four workloads running on the hardware we simulated. However, speculationwill not improve performance in every conceivable environment. Thegoal of this section is to explore the boundaries of speculation’s benefit—tocharacterize the transition between beneficial and harmful speculation. We dothis by perturbing the software workload and hardware configurations beyondtheir normal limits to see where the benefits of spec
