Increasing the number ofhardware contexts (while maintaining the same number and mix of functionalunits and number of issue slots) will increase the number of independent andnonspeculative instructions, and thus will decrease the likelihood that speculationwill benefit SMT. Conversely, reducing the number of contexts shouldincrease speculation’s value.One metric that illustrates the effect of in
