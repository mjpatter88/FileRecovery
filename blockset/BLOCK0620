ue negatives). Second, it increases the numberof correct predictions the processor ignores (false negatives).Table III contains true and false negatives for the baseline SMT and an SMTwith several hard confidence schemes when executing SPECINT95. Since ourMacFarling branch predictor [McFarling 1993] has high accuracy (workloaddependentpredictions that range from 88% to 99%), the false negatives outnumberthe true negatives by between 3 and 6 times. Therefore, although mispredictionsdeclined by 14% to
