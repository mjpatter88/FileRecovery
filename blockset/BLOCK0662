uperscalars, simultaneous multithreaded (SMT) processors achievehigh resource utilization by issuing instructions from multiple threads every cycle. An SMT processorthus has two means of hiding latency: speculation and multithreaded execution. However, thesetwo techniques may conflict; on an SMT processor, wrong-path speculative instructions from onethread may compete with and displace useful instructions from another thread. For this reason, itis important to understand the trade-offs between these tw
