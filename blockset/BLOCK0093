from the pipeline beforethey reached the functional units, only consuming resources in the form of integerinstruction queue entries, renaming registers, and fetch bandwidth. Boththe instruction queue (IQ) and the pool of renaming registers are adequatelysized: the IQ is only full 4.3% of cycles and renaming registers are exhaustedonly 0.3% of cycles. (Doubling the integer IQ for SPECINT95 reduced queueoverflow to 0.4% of cycles, but raised IPC by only 1.8%, confirming that the integerIQ is not a seri
