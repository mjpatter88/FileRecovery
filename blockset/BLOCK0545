rmed no speculation (the worst) and the hard confidence distanceestimator but fell short of the hard confidence JRS and strong count estimators. For all fourworkloads, SMT with ICOUNT is the best performer, although, for SPECINT95 and SPECINTCFP,the hard distance estimator (threshD1) obtains essentially identical performance.estimation (i.e., the processor speculates if the branch prediction is correct andstalls if it is incorrect) provides only a 5% improvement over ICOUNT in thenumber of contexts re
