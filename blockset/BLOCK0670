unctional units. When the IQ holds instructions from many threads, thechance of a large number of them being unable to issue instructions is greatlyreduced, and SMT can best hide intra-thread latencies. However, when fewerthreads are present, it is less able to avoid these delays.2SMTwith ICOUNT provides the highest average number of threads in the IQfor all four workloads when compared to any of the alternative fetch policies orconfidence estimators. Executing SPECINT95 with soft confidence can serve
