late past branches. Overall, SMT derives its benefit from this finegrainedinterleaving of instructions from multiple threads in the IQ. Therefore,policies that reduce the pool of participating threads (e.g., to favor nonspeculatingthreads) tend to reduce performance.These results hold for a broad range of hardware configurations and workloads.Only machines with a very high ratio of contexts to issue slots andACM Transactions on Computer Systems, Vol. 21, No. 3, August 2003.Speculative Instruction Exe
