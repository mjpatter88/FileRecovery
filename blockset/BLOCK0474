erage speedup across all threads.We then compared this value to a speedup calculated just using the total IPCof the workload. We found that the two metrics produced very similar results,differing on average by just 1% and at most by 5%. Moreover, none of the performancetrends or conclusions changed based on which metric was used. Consequently,for the configurations we consider, using total IPC to compare performanceis accurate. Since IPC is a more intuitive metric to discuss than thespeedup averaged
