ve explored issues in branch prediction, confidence estimation,and speculation, both on superscalars and multithreaded processors.Others have studied related topics, such as software speculation and valueprediction.Wall [1994] examines the relationships between branch prediction and availableparallelism on a superscalar and concludes that good branch predictors cansignificantly enhance the amount of parallelism available to the processor. Hilyand Seznec [1996] investigate the effectiveness of various
