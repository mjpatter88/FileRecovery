; the simulation includes all OS privileged code, interrupts, drivers,and Alpha PALcode. The operating system execution accounts for only a smallportion of the cycles executed for the SPEC workloads (about 5%), while themajority of cycles (77%) for the Apache Web server are spent inside the OSmanaging the network and disk.Most experiments include 200 million cycles of simulation starting from apoint 600 million instructions into each program (simulated in ‘fast mode’). Thesynthetic benchmarks, owing
