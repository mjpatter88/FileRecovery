d performance could be sacrificed infavor of a simpler, thoughput-oriented design. In this light, a 16-context SMTmight indeed be a reasonable machine to build, despite the complexity of itsdynamic issue logic. Not only would it eliminate the speculative hardware,but the large number of threads would make it much easier to hide the largememory latency often associated with server workloads.Still, forthcoming SMT architectures will most likely have a higher, ratherthan a lower, ratio of functional uni
