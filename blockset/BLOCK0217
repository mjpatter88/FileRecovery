h prediction policies in the processor. Our results quantify the extent to which (1) speculationis critical to performance on a multithreaded processor because it ensures an ample supply of parallelismto feed the functional units, and (2) SMT actually enhances the effectiveness of speculativeexecution, compared to a superscalar processor by reducing the impact of branch misprediction.Finally, we quantify the impact of both hardware configuration and workload characteristics onspeculation’s usefulness a
