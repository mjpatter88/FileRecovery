les—3.6 times longer.We can use fetch-to-fetch delay to explore the effects of varying the numberof contexts in our baseline configuration. With 16 contexts (running two copiesof each of the 8 SPECINT95 programs), the fetch-to-fetch delay rises to 10.0cycles (3 cycles longer than the branch delay), and the difference between IPCwith and without speculation falls from 24% for 8 contexts to 0% with 16 (seeFigure 7), signaling the point at which speculation should start hurting SMTperformance.At first
