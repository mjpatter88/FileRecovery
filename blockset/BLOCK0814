fect our results.We also used a synthetic workload to explore how branch prediction accuracy,branch frequency, and the amount of ILP affect speculation on an SMT.The synthetic program executes a continuous stream of instructions separatedby branches. We varied the average number and independence of instructionsbetween branches, and the prediction accuracy of the branches is set by a commandline argument to the simulator.We execute all of our workloads under the Compaq Tru64 Unix 4.0d operatingsystem
