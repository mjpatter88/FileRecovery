However, as we will see in Figure 6, branch predictionaccuracy generally has to be extremely poor to tip the balance againstspeculation.Second, although we investigated only a few of the many conceivablespeculation-aware fetch policies, there is little hope that a different speculationawarefetch policy could improve per
