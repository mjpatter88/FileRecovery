ulative execution begin todisappear.4.1 Examining Program CharacteristicsThree different workload characteristics determine whether speculation is profitableon an SMT processor:(1) As branch prediction accuracy decreases, the number of wrong-path instructionswill increase, causing performance to drop. Speculation will becomeless useful and at some point will no longer pay off.(2) As the basic block size increases, branches become less frequent and thenumber of threads with no unresolved branches in
