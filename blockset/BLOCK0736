dware contexts,the greater the global (cross-thread) pool of instructions available to hide intrathreadlatencies. All the mechanisms we have investigated that restrict speculationdo so by eliminating certain threads from consideration for fetchingduring some period of time, either by assigning them a low priority or excludingthem outright.The consequence of restricting the pool of fetchable threads is a less diversethread mix in the instruction queue, where instructions wait to be dispatchedto the f
