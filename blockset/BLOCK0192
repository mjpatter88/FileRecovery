anches, that is, the basicblock size. The different lines represent varying amounts of ILP. The verticalaxis is the branch prediction accuracy required for speculation to pay off for agiven average basic block size4; that is, for any given point, speculation will payoff for branch prediction accuracy values above the point but hurt performance4The synthetic workload for a particular average basic block size contained basic blocks of a varietyof sizes. This helps to make the measurements independent of
