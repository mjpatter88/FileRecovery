ould be particularly true for SMT’slikely-targeted application domain: highly threaded, high-performance servers,with all hardware contexts occupied. In this scenario, speculative (and potentiallywasteful) instructions from one thread may compete with useful, nonspeculativeinstructions from other threads for highly utilized hardware resources,and in some cases displace them, lowering performance. This raisesthe possibility that SMT might be able to capitalize on its inherent latencyhidingabilities to
