ine running with fewer than 8 threads. Most workloads, with theexception of heavily loaded servers, may not be able to keep all 8 contextscontinuously busy. In these cases, fetch-to-fetch delay will decrease as it did forfewer contexts, and speculation will provide similar benefit.4.2.2 Functional Units. We also varied the number of integer functionalunits between 2 and 10. In each case, one FU can execute synchronizationinstructions, while the others can perform loads and stores. All the units execut
