. 1996], and because it represents the serverworkloads that constitute one of SMT’s target domains. We selected the floatingpoint suite because it contains loop-based code with large basic blocks andmore predictable branches than integer code, providing an important perspectiveon workloads where speculation is more beneficial. Finally, following theexample of Snavely and Tullsen [2000], we combined floating point and integercode to understand how interactions between different types of applicationsaf
