SMT. They observe that SMT speculates less deeply past branches, resultingin less power being spent on useless instructions. We examine the effectof hardware configuration on SMT’s speculative performance and behavior inmore detail and demonstrate the connection between fetch policy, the numberof hardware contexts, and how aggressively SMT speculates.Lo et al. [1997b] investigated the effect of SMT’s architecture on the designof several compiler optimizations, including software speculation. They foun
