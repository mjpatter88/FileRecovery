The confidence value for a branch is the number of correct predictionsthat a context has made in a row (globally, not just for this branch).ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, Vol. 21, No. 3, August 2003.Speculative Instruction Execution on Simultaneous Multithreaded Processors ² 327Table III.
