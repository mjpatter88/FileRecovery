and data caches might affect how important speculation is to SMT performance.To quantify this effect we simulated level-1 data and instruction caches rangingfrom 16KB to 128KB, with and without speculation. Table VI contains theresults.The data show that increasing the size of the level-1 caches decreases the benefitfrom speculation. There are two reasons for this: First, larger data cachesproduce less memory latency that needs to be hidden during execution, andtherefore speculation is less necessary
