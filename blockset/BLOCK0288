amechanism is unlikely.3.3 SummaryIn this section we examine the performance of SMT processors with speculativeinstruction execution. Without speculation, an 8-context SMT is unableto provide a sufficient instruction stream to keep the processor fully utilized,and performance suffers. Although the fetch policies we examined reduce thenumber of wrong-path instructions, they also limit thread diversity in the IQ,leading to lower performance when compared to ICOUNT.4.
