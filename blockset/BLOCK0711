 asa case in point.With soft confidence, the processor tends to fetch repeatedly fromthreads that have high confidence branches, filling the IQ with instructionsfrom a few threads. Consequently, there are no issuable instructions between2.8% and 4.2% of the time, which is 3 to 4.5 times more often than with ICOUNT.The result is that the IQ backs up more often (12 to 15% of cycles versus 4% withICOUNT), causing the processor to stop fetching. This also explains why none ofthe new policies improved per
