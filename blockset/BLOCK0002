rocessor stalls a thread on a low confidencebranch, fetching from other threads until the branch is resolved. In the second,soft confidence, the processor assigns a fetch priority according to the confidenceof a thread’s most recent branch.Hard confidence schemes use a confidence threshold to divide branches intohigh- and low-confidence groups. If the confidence value is above the threshold,the prediction is followed; otherwise, the issuing thread stalls until the branchis resolved. Hard confidence u
