ous bottleneck. Tullsen et al. [1996] report a similar result.)Thus, IQ entries and renaming registers are not highly contended. This leavesfetch bandwidth as the only resource that speculation wastes significantly andsuggests that modifying the fetch policy might improve performance. We addressthis question in the next section.Without speculation, only nonspeculative instructions use processor resourcesand SMT devotes no processor resources to wrong-path instructions.1The prediction rate is lower th
