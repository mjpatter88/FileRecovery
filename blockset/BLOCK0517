e structuresand pipeline stages are affected by speculation, and how speculation on SMTprocessors differs from speculation on a traditional superscalar. Finally, we explorethe boundaries of speculation’s usefulness on SMT by varying the numberof hardware threads, the number of functional units, and the cache capacities,and by using synthetic workloads to change the branch frequency and ILPwithin threads.After describing the methodology for our experiments in the next section,we present the basic spe
