ing instructions from additionalthreads; if only one or a few threads are executing, then all criticalhardware resources are available to them. Consequently, instruction throughputon a fully loaded SMT processor is two to four times higher than ona superscalar with comparable hardware on a variety of integer, scientific,database, and web service workloads [Lo et al. 1997a,b; Redstone et al.2000].With its high hardware utilization, speculation on an SMT may harmrather than improve performance.
