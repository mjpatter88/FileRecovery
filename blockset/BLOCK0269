cution on Simultaneous Multithreaded Processors ² 337functional units or workloads with very large basic block sizes warranted reducingor eliminating speculation. Our results demonstrate that there are interestingmicroarchitectural trade-offs between speculation, implementationcomplexity, and single-threaded performance that make the decisions of howand when to speculate on SMT processors more complex than they are on traditionalsuperscalar processors.APPENDIXTables VII–X contain a summary of data f
