96; Grunwald et al. 1998]. Each dynamic branch receives a confidence rating,a high value for branches that are usually predicted correctly and a low value formisbehaving branches. Several groups have suggested using confidence estimatorson SMT to reduce wrong-path-speculative instructions and thus improveperformance [Jacobson et al. 1996; Manne et al. 1998]. In our study we examinedthree different confidence estimators discussed in Grunwald et al. [1998];Jacobson et al. [1996]:—The JRS estimator uses
