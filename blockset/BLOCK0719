most: 63% of fetched instructionsand 60% of executed instructions are speculative. Given the magnitude ofthese numbers and the accuracy of today’s branch prediction hardware, it is notsurprising that stalling until branches resolve failed to improved performance.Speculation is particulary effective on SMT for two reasons, as SPECINT95illustrates. First, since SMT fetches from each thread only once every 5.4 cycleson average for this workload (as opposed to almost every cycle for thesingle-threaded su
