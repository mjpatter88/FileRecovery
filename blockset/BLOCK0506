creasing the number of hardwarecontexts is the number of cycles between two consecutive fetches from the samecontext, or fetch-to-fetch delay. As the fetch-to-fetch delay increases, it becomesmore likely that the branch will resolve before the thread fetches again. Thiscauses individual threads to speculate less aggressively, and makes speculationless critical to performance. For a superscalar, the fetch-to-fetch delay is1.4 cycles. For an 8-context SMT with ICOUNT, the fetch-to-fetch delay is 5.0cyc
