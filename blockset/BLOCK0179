ctions. To investigate these possibilities,we comparedSMT with ICOUNT to an SMT with two alternative fetch policies: one thatfavors nonspeculating threads and a family of fetch policies that incorporatebranch prediction confidence.3.1.2 Favoring Nonspeculative Contexts. A fetch policy that favors nonspeculativecontexts (see Figures 1–4) increased the proportion of nonspeculativeinstructions fetched by an average of 44% and decreased correctpath-and wrong-path-speculative instructions by an average of
