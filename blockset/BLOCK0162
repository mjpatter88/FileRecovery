described in Section 2.2) on the baseline SMT with ICOUNT (Section 2.1). Forinstance, a thread with an ILP of 4 and a basic block size of 16 instructionscould issue all instructions in 4 cycles, while a thread with an ILP of 1 wouldneed 16 cycles; the former workload requires that branch prediction accuracybe worse than 95% in order for speculation to hurt performance; the latter (ILP1) requires that it be lower than 46%.The four labeled points represent the average basic block sizes and branchpredic
