 a cache miss, each cycle. (For 128KB caches, an averageof 6.6 contexts are eligible, while for a 16KB cache the number drops to 3.9contexts.) Frequent instruction cache misses have the same negative effect onthe IQ as restricting speculation: for the speculative configurations, the numberof contexts represented falls from 5.3 with 128KB caches to 4.9 with 16KBcaches.These results support our conclusion that speculation is desirable in the vastmajority of cases.5.
