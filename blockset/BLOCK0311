gins to tax the amount of nonspeculativeILP available, but the benefit does not increase uniformly with issue width.As the number of FUs rises there are two competing effects. First, the processorneeds to fetch more instructions to fill the additional functional units,making speculation more important. Second, the instruction queue drains morequickly, causing the average branch delay to decrease (9.4 cycles with 6 FUs,8.8 with 8 FUs). As a result, threads on the nonspeculating machines spend lesstime
