the problem by fetching from several threads and thereby increasing thefetch-to-fetch delay.We investigate the notion of fetch-to-fetch delay in the contextof SMT and demonstrate that high fetch-to-fetch delays can reduce theneed for speculation.Jacobson et al. [1996], Grunwald et al. [1998], and Manne et al. [1998] suggestusing confidence estimators for a wide variety of applications, includingreducing power consumption and moderating speculation on SMT to increaseperformance. Grunwald et al. [1998]
