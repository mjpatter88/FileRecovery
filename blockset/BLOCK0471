 However, for the rangeof values we explore here, there is an interesting trade-off between the cost ofadditional functional units and the complexity cost of speculation. For instance,a nonspeculative machine with 6 functional units outperforms a speculative 4FU machine by 7% and an 8 FU, nonspeculative machine outperforms the 4 FUconfiguration by 12%.4.2.3 Cache Size. The memory hierarchy is a significant source of the latencythat speculation attempts to hide. Therefore, the size of the instruction
