astehardware resources. Speculative instructions on an SMT comprise the majorityof instructions fetched, executed, and committed. In the case of SPECINT95(Figure 1), for example, 57% of fetch IPC, 53% of instructions issued to the functionalunits, and 52% of commit IPC are speculative. (Comparable numbersfor the superscalar are between 90 and 93%.) SPECFP95 and INTCFP fetchfewer speculative instructions, but they still account for a substantial portionof the instruction stream. Apache speculates the
