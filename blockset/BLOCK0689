oads, suggesting that the behavior is fundamental to SMT, ratherthan being workload dependent. Because of this, we present data primarily forSPECINT95, and discuss the other workloads only when it contributes to theACM Transactions on Computer Systems, Vol. 21, No. 3, August 2003.Speculative Instruction Execution on Simultaneous Multithreaded Processors ² 321Fig. 1. Per-pipeline-stage IPC for SPECINT95, divided between correct-path-, wrong-path-, andnon-speculative instructions. On top, (a) SMT with I
