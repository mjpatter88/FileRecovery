 a table that is indexed by the PC xor-ed with theglobal branch history register. The table contains counters that are incrementedwhen the predictor is correct and reset on an incorrect prediction.—The strong-count estimator uses the counters in the local and global predictorsto assign confidence. The confidence value is the number of countersfor the branch (0, 1, or 2) that are in a strongly-taken or strongly-nottakenstate (this subsumes the both-strong and either-strong estimators inGrunwald et al.
