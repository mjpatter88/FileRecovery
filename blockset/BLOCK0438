tion accuracies for SPECINT95, SPECFP95, INTCFP, and Apache onSMT with ICOUNT. SPECINT95 has a branch prediction accuracy of 88% and6.6 instructions between branches. According to the graph, such a workloadwould need branch prediction accuracy to be worse than 65% for speculation tobe harmful. Likewise, given the same information for SPECFP95 (18.2 instructionsbetween branches,5 99% prediction accuracy), INTCFP (10.5 instructionsbetween branches, 90% prediction accuracy) and Apache (4.9 instructions b
