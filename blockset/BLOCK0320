An Evaluation of SpeculativeInstruction Execution on SimultaneousMultithreaded ProcessorsSTEVEN SWANSON, LUKE K. McDOWELL, MICHAEL M. SWIFT,SUSAN J. EGGERS and HENRY M. LEVYUniversity of WashingtonModern superscalar processors rely heavily on speculative execution for performance. For example,our measurements show that on a 6-issue superscalar, 93% of committed instructions forSPECINT95 are speculative. Without speculation, processor resources on such machines wouldbe largely idle. In contrast to s
