 SMT with ICOUNT; on the bottom, (b) SMT with a fetch policythat favors non-speculative instructions.ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, Vol. 21, No. 3, August 2003.Speculative Instruction Execution on Simultaneous Multithreaded Processors ² 325analysis. Tables VII–X in the Appendix contain a summary of the data for allfetch policies we investigated.The upper portions of Figures 1–4 (labeled ‘A’) show why speculation is crucialto high instruction throughput and explain why misspeculation does not w
