1998] uses spare SMT contexts to execute down both possiblepaths of a branch. They augment ICOUNT to favor the highest confidence pathas determined by a JRS estimator and only create new speculative threadsfor branches on this path. Although they assume that there are one or moreunutilized contexts (while our work focuses on more heavily loaded scenarios),their work complements our own. Both show that speculation pays off when fewthreads are active, either because hardware contexts are available (thei
