over threads, in this paper we report only the IPC for eachexperiment.3. SPECULATION ON SMTThis section presents the results of our simulation experiments on instructionspeculation for SMT. Our goal is to understand the trade-offs between two alternativemeans of hiding branch delays: instruction speculation and SMT’sability to execute instructions from multiple threads each cycle. First, we comparethe performance of an SMT processor with and without speculation andanalyze the differences between the
