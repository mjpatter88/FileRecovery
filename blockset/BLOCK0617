efits of correct-path speculative instructions greatly outweigh anyharm caused by hardware resources going to wrong-path speculativeinstructions;—multithreading actually enhances speculation, by reducing the percentage ofspeculative instructions on the wrong path.We also showed that multiple contexts provide a significant advantage forSMT relative to a superscalar with respect to speculative execution; namely,by interleaving instructions, multithreading reduces the distance that threadsneed to specu
