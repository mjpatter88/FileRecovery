ine and the memorysystem. For example, speculation could pollute the cache with instructionsthat will never be executed or, alternatively, prefetch instructions before theyare needed, eliminating future cache misses. None of these effects appear in oursimulations, and turning off speculation never altered the percentage of cachehits by more that 0.4%.To understand how speculative instructions execute on an SMT processorand how they benefit its performance and resource utilization, we categorizedinst
