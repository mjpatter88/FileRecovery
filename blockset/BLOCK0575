Swanson et al.However, in avoiding wrong-path instructions, SMT leaves many of its hardwareresources idle. For example, fetch stall cycles—cycles when no threadwas fetched, rose almost three-fold for Apache; consequently, its per-stage IPCsdropped between 13% and 35%. Functional utilization dropped by 16% and commitIPC, the bottom-line metric for SMT
