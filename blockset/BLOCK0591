For instance, although the distribution of instructions between thethree categories changes, in all cases between 82 and 86% of wrong-path instructionsleave the pipeline before they reach the functional units and nomore than 2% of instruction executed are on the wrong path. The similarityimplies that the conclusions for SPECINT95 are applicable to the otherthree workl
