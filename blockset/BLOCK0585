 33% and 39%,respectively. Despite the moderate shift to useful instructions (wrong-pathspeculativeinstructions were reduced from 11% to 7% of the workload), theeffect on commit IPC was negligible. This lack of improvement in IPC will beaddressed again and explained in Section 3.2.3.1.3 Using Confidence Estimators. Researchers have proposed severalhardware structures that assign confidence levels to branch predictions, withthe goal of reducing the number of wrong-path speculations [Jacobson et al.19
