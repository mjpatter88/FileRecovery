er programs and operating systems do not. Likewise, it is doubtfulthat branch prediction hardware (or even static branch prediction strategies)will exhibit poor enough performance to warrant turning off speculation withbasic block sizes typical of today’s workloads. For example, our simulationsof SPECINT95 with a branch predictor one-sixteenth the size of our baselinepredictor correctly predicts only 70% of branches, but still experiences a 9.5%speedup over not speculating.4.2 Examining Hardware Char
