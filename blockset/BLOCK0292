 reduce the need for speculation. If SMT could do withoutspeculation while maintaining the same level of performance, it mightdispense with the complicated control necessary to recover from mispeculations.To resolve this issue, it is important to understand the behavior ofspeculation on an SMT processor and the extent to which it helps or hindersperformance.In investigating speculation on SMT, this paper makes three principlecontributions:—A careful analysis of the interactions between speculation a
