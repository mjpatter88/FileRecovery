s. For theSPECINT benchmarks, for example, 19% of speculative instructions on SMTare wrong path, compared to 28% on a superscalar. Therefore, SMT receivessignificant benefit from speculation at a lower cost, compared to a superscalar.Second, the data show that speculation is not particularly wasteful on SMT.Branch prediction accuracy for SPECINT95 is 88%,1 and only 11% of fetchedinstructions were flushed from the pipeline. Eighty-three percent of thesewrong-path-speculative instructions were removed
