ce 4.9 2.9%we see that soft confidence estimators hurt performance, despite the fact thatthey reduced wrong-path-speculative instructions to between 0.1% and 9% ofinstructions fetched.Overall, then, neither hard nor soft confidence estimators improved SMTperformance, and actually reduced performance in most cases.3.2 Why Restricting Speculation Hurts SMT PerformanceSMT derives its performance benefits from fetching and executing instructionsfrom multiple threads. The greater the number of active har
