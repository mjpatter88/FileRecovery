culation results and explain why and how speculationbenefits SMT performance; this section also discusses alternative fetch and predictionschemes and shows why they fall short. Section 4 continues our analysisof speculation, exploring the effects of software and microarchitectural parameterson speculation. Finally, Section 5 discusses related work and Section 6summarizes our findings.2. METHODOLOGY2.1 SimulatorOur SMT simulator is based on the SMTSIM simulator [Tullsen 1996] andhas been ported to t
