dthat software speculation on SMT was useful for loop-based codes, but hurtperformance on non-loop applications.6. SUMMARYThis paper examined and analyzed the behavior of speculative instructionson simultaneous multithreaded processors. Using both multiprogrammed andmultithreaded workloads, we showed that:—speculation is required to achieve maximum performance on an SMT;—fetch policies and branch confidence estimators that favor nonspeculativeexecution succeed only in reducing performance;—the ben
