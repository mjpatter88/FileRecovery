ructions according to their speculation behavior:—non-speculative instructions are those fetched non-speculatively—they alwaysperform useful work;—correct-path-speculative instructions are fetched speculatively, are on thecorrect path of execution, and therefore accomplish useful work;—wrong-path-speculative instructions are fetched speculatively, but lie onincorrect execution paths, are thus ultimately flushed from the executionpipeline and consequently waste hardware resources.Using this categoriz
