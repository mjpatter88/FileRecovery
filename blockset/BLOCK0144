ts to hardware contexts than even ourSMT prototype, which has 6 integer units and 8 contexts. For example, therecently canceled Compaq 21464 [Emer 1999] would have been an 8-widemachine with only four contexts, suggesting that speculation would providemuch of its performance. Supporting this conclusion, our baseline configurationwith four contexts has a fetch-to-fetch delay of 2.5, and speculation doublesperformance.The data for the 1-, 2-, and 4-context machines also correspond to an 8-context mach
