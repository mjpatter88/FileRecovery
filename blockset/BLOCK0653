ollowing this example, we computed the geometric mean ofthe threads’ speedups in IPC relative to their performance on a machine usingthe baseline ICOUNT fetch policy and executing the same threads on the samenumber of contexts. Finally, because our workload contains some threads (suchas interrupt handlers) that run for only a small fraction of total simulation cycles,we weighted the per-thread speedups by the number of cycles the threadwas scheduled in a context.Using this technique we computed an av
