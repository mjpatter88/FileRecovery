 performance byexecuting the likely branch path without stalling. Branch predictors, whichprovide accuracies up to 96% (excluding OS code) [Gwennap 1995], are thekey to effective speculation. The primary disadvantage of speculation is thatsome processor resources are invariably allocated to useless, wrong-path instructionsthat must be flushed from the pipeline. However, since resources onsuperscalars are often underutilized because of low single-thread instructionlevelparallelism (ILP) [Tullsen et al
