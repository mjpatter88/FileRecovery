synthetic workload that allows us to manipulate basic-blocklength and available ILP. Using these workloads, we carefully examine howspeculative instructions behave on SMT, as well as how and when SMT shouldspeculate.We attempt to improve speculation performance on SMT by reducing wrongpathspeculative instructions, either by not speculating at all or by usingspeculation-aware fetch policies (including policies that incorporate confidenceestimators). To explain the results, we investigate which hardwar
