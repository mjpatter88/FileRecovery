omparing the total IPC with two differentfetch policies may not be fair, since a different mix of instructions is executed,and the contribution of each thread to the bottom-line IPC changes.We resolved this problem by following the example set by the SPECratemetric [System Performance Evaluation Cooperative 2000] and averaging performanceacross threads instead of cycles. The SPECrate is the percent increasein throughput (IPC) relative to a baseline for each thread, combined using thegeometric mean. F
