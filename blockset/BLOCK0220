presented in the IQ.Figure 5 empirically demonstrates the effect of thread diversity on performancefor all the schemes discussed in this paper, on all workloads (see alsoTables VII–X). For all four workloads, there is a clear correlation between performanceand the number of threads present; ICOUNT achieves the largestvalue for both metrics3 in most cases.We draw two conclusions from this discussion. First, the key to speculation’sbenefit is its low cost compared to the benefit of the diverse thread m
