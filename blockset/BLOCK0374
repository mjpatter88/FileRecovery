 waiting for branches to resolve and can fetch more often, reducing the costof not speculating. The result is that speculation provides a 29% performanceboost with 6 FUs but only 22% with 8 and 10 FUs, although functional unitutilization is lower (65% with 6 FUs, 55% with 8 FUs, and 44% with 10). Asthe number of FUs climbs, the scarcity of available ILP will dominate, becausethe average branch delay will approach a minimum value determined by thepipeline (there are 7 stages between fetch and execute).
